## The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

## 12+22+...+102=385
## The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

## (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
## Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

## Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# We can use the geometric sum as well as guasses equations for sum of first n numbers squared
